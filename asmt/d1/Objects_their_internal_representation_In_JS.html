        Objects - An introduction
        1. Objects are the only non-primitive data types in JS. Moreover, they are user-defined data types.
        2. A primitive typed data always means a single primitive value whereas objects can store multiple primitives apart from other components.
        3. An Object in JS is like a real-world entity, say a Tooth brush. 
        An object has a set of states within it and is capable of certain behaviors or functionality, just as a toothbrush has a set of states (color = red, type =  soft, price = 100Rs) and can perform actions such as brushing & toungue cleaning.
        

        JS Objects are key-value pairs:
        1. Objects in JS are essentially a collection of key-value pairs. 
        Keys are always of the type string whereas values can be any primitive data type (number, string, boolean...etc), non-primitive data type (arrays, other objects...etc) or even functions.
        2. Objects can be precisely described as:
        'A comma-delimited list of zero or more pairs of property names (keys) and associated values of an object, enclosed within flower braces'.
        

        Objects vs JSON - a brief comparison:
        1. JSON stands for Java Script Object Notation. It is a geneal format to represent values and objects.
        JSON is a strict subset of object literal syntax [, except in one aspect - the __proto__ key being present].
        2. JSON does not allow functions but objects do allow them.


        Defining an object:
            -template based definition instead of class based.
            obj literal, new object(), obj.create(), constructor syntaxes
        

        Adding, Deleting, Updating key-value pairs:


        Internal represention in memory:
            -frames (stack), object memory (heap), obj as reference data type
            -about no hard and fast 'only heap' allocation
            -details different across different engines(V8, spidermonkey...etc)


        Retrieving values:
            dot and [] syntaxes, their comparison
        

        Iterating over object values:
            For..in loop, Obj.entries, comparison


        Additional relevant concepts that can be explored further by the reader: 
            -Object copy (by reference, shallow copy, deep copy)
            -Object to JSON and vice versa
